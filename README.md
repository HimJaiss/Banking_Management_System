**Banking Management System**

A Java-based Banking Management System that simulates real-world banking operations including account creation, deposits, withdrawals, balance inquiry, and fund transfers. The project was independently developed during my MCA to showcase proficiency in Core Java and object-oriented programming concepts.

🧠 **Project Overview**

The Banking Management System is designed to manage and automate common banking activities through a simple and user-friendly interface. It helps understand how real-world banking software handles customer accounts and transactions.

The system focuses on correctness, data handling, and structured program design using Java.

🎯 **Objectives**

1. Understand real-world banking workflows
2. Apply Object-Oriented Programming concepts
3. Perform secure and structured financial operations
4. Practice Java programming with logical design

🛠️ **Technologies Used**

1. Java (Core Java)
2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
3. JDBC / File Handling (based on implementation)
4. Command Line

✨ **Features**

1. Create new bank accounts
2. Deposit money into accounts
3. Withdraw money from accounts
4. Check account balance
5. Transfer money between accounts
6. Store and manage account details
7. Simple and easy-to-use interface

📂 **Project Structure**

The project typically includes:

1. Java source files (.java)
2. Main class to run the application
3. Account and transaction handling classes
4. Database or file-based storage logic

📦 **Prerequisites**

Before running the project, ensure you have:

1. Java JDK 8 or higher installed
2. Any Java IDE (Eclipse / IntelliJ / NetBeans)
3. Database setup (only if JDBC is used)

🚀 **How to Run**

1. Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/HimJaiss/Banking_Management_System.git
    cd Banking_Management_System

2. Open the project in your Java IDE.
3. Compile and run the main class:

    java BankingManagementSystem

Follow the on-screen menu to perform banking operations.

🧠 **Working Principle**

1. User selects an operation from the menu
2. System validates input data
3. Requested banking operation is performed
4. Account details are updated
5. Data is saved for future access

📊 **Example Operations**

1. Account Creation
2. Balance Inquiry
3. Deposit & Withdrawal
4. Fund Transfer

Each operation updates account records accurately.

🔮 **Future Enhancements**

1. Add Graphical User Interface (GUI)
2. Integrate secure database authentication
3. Transaction history and reports
4. Admin and user roles
5. Improved error handling and validation
